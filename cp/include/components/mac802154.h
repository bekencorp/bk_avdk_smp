 * @param channel The channel to transmit. channel range is 11~26. 
 *                The channel should be the same as the channel used for rx channel of DUT.
 * @param tx_cnt The number of packets to transmit
 * @param pass_cnt_thre The number of packets to pass the test
 *
 * @return
 *   - BK_OK: TX started or stopped successfully; for finite TX, all packets completed before timeout
 *   - BK_ERR_PARAM: invalid channel, valid range is 11~26
 *   - BK_ERR_BUSY: another TX/RX/DUT test is already running, stop it before starting TX

 * @brief  Enter the DUT mode
 *
