/*
 * Explicit FSM for AP-side bridge state transitions.
 *
 * Previously the codebase open-coded
 *     bk_bridge_ctx_set_state_local(X);
 *     bk_wifi_sync_bridge_state(X);
 * at every transition point.  That had three problems:
 *
 *   1. Two-step pattern is easy to forget the IPC sync (which is exactly
 *      what produced the race we fixed in switch_bridge_to_sta).
 *   2. Nothing rejects an illegal jump (e.g. DISABLED -> ENABLED).
 *   3. No place to add observability - tracing, stats, watchpoints.
 *
 * bk_bridge_fsm_transition() is the only sanctioned way to mutate the
 * AP-side bridge state.  It:
 *
 *   - serializes concurrent transitions (CLI thread vs wifi-event task)
 *     through an internal mutex;
 *   - rejects illegal source->target pairs against a static table;
 *   - writes the local ctx and dispatches the synchronous IPC to CP as
 *     one atomic step under the lock - so the AP-local view never gets
 *     ahead of CP's view across the IPC barrier;
 *   - invokes the registered observer (no-op by default).
 *
 * CP is a passive follower: it stores whatever AP tells it through
 * SET_BRIDGE_SYNC_STATE.  We do NOT replicate this FSM on CP.
